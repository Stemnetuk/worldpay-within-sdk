Executive Summary
=================

It is estimated that there will be 6 billion devices connected to the
Internet of Things (IoT) by the end of 2016 and 20 billion by 2020[^1].
Some of these devices will consume services from other devices for which
a payment will be required.

Worldpay propose to facilitate these payments by a secure payment engine
“Worldpay Within” which can be deployed to devices and utilise the
Worldpay Online.worldpay.com platform for IoT payments. By using a set
of APIs “Thing” developers will be able to integrate Worldpay Within
into their IoT device, enabling the “Thing” to make and / or receive
payments for services to and from other “Things” in the IoT.
