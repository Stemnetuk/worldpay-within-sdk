# The Java Wrapper - For Worldpay Within

Note to setup the Java project, you just need to import the source project, and the libs and it will compile and you can go from there.

## Setup

For example in Netbeans
* Create a new Java application project at a location of your preference
* Clone the repo, so you have a copy of the Java wrapper
* Copy in the source directory from the repo to the Java application (through the file system)
* Copy in the libs/jars to the Java application that come with the repo (through the file system)
* Import the jars into the project
* If the application has not built, build the application
* You should then be able to run the application test, however more intersting is running the test apps; 

## Running the test apps
